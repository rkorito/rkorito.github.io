	<h2>Hobby</h2>
	</div>

	<p><b>Rabbits are my hobby.</b> I've had been involved with recuses, protests, 
	and many events that help ensure the welfare of rabbits. I have two of my own at home, 
	Joey and Joplin. Named after my some of my musical idols, Joey Ramone and Janis Joplin. 
	Rabbits have been a major part in my life since high school, finding wild baby rabbits 
	in my backyard while attempting to nurse them back to health. This proved to be 
	extremely difficult and scarring in the process. I've quickly grown a fascination 
	that will stick with me for life.</p>
